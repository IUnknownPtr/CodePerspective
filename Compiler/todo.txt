try overlaying paths on blocks - odds are a lot of paths are internal


option to turn off constructed count/thread ID
max stack to 3 in constructor/deconstructor, just 3 by default??
max stack 0 to 2

how to detect if app is 32 bit only? storm is 32, decompiling and recompiling make it 64 bit app.. need a xlib 32 as well then

auto-ignore de-compile errors and compile what we can

ability to gen conflict detection should turn on/off
	if off code not generated, and library knows not to iterate conflict array

building storm ui
pe verify fails
implement pe verify check and confirm failure shown
fix failure -> maxstack from 0 to 2

verification
	progress bar of file ops
	get output of console op
	handle compiles / verifys in try catch, break on fail
	if ilasm throws failed, mark item as (failed asm) else done
	delete key removes item from list, recompile to restart
	any way to hide compile windows
	run pe verify on new exe, if fail mark (failed ver)
	on verify copy over
	
	
few squares out of places
fading still looks like pulsing flickering
wells research project has a big space in it
turn conflicts orange

how to draw/show anonymous methods
	
dont draw or recurse rects that are too small, smaller than 2 pix in width


test with release mode

build execution path and show dots moving from node 2 node
	how to know function is returning - add tag to function exit? investigate il

heap tree map


different colors per thread
	6 red orange yellow green blue purple
	black interlace when threads intersect
	array 0 - 5
	map thread id to array index
	every sec, clear map but keep colors as pref if thread checks in, if not pref is cleared

stack planes - size number of instances
	override ctor / deconstructor and add counters
	for now put number inside box
	need to research iso view mapping, wpf display
	if ctor/finalize not found, create it
	
use gdi painting without paint event	

option to force garbage collection


wpf
	test cubing tree map, and coloring, default height
	get movement controls working
    block everything, height by instance count
    only hit funcs is very useful to cut down on drawing
    
    wsad/mouselook fly through, click highlights selected
