
recommit - proj set to 32 bit before

bugs 
	storm ui still doesnt build
    open wells dat file and trace bad drawing blocks

build
	options - track construction, threads, ignore on decompile errors
	progress bar of file ops
	ability to pause tracking in interface
	some sort of bread crumbs in visualizer to go forward/back more easily - could be done with wrap panel
	time how long it takes to do redraw, option to draw less frames, option to set fps, which mods frames/timer settings - option in viz
	
advanced
	get to work with dlls, users pick entry function, should make asp tracking work
	
flow tracking
	try overlaying paths on blocks - odds are a lot of paths are internal
	how to know function is returning - add tag to function exit? investigate il
	build execution path and show dots moving from node 2 node
	
memory tracking
	heap dump tree map ;) can figure out where allocated??

function tree map
	few squares out of places
	fading still looks like pulsing flickering
	wells research project has a big space in it
	turn conflicts orange
	how to draw/show anonymous methods
	option to track anonymous methods	
	dont draw or recurse rects that are too small, smaller than 2 pix in width

3d function tree map
	constant square size, height dependnent on amount of code (cities)
	fly through like hackers
	taller towards middle of box
	load IL and write on the walls of the cube
	
heap tree map
	how to get memory allocated from gc, source to clr profiler?


release 
	open source with donate button
	put donate button in about of app as well,
	link to my page with other projects like rise op, cant hurt


different colors per thread
	6 red orange yellow green blue purple
	black interlace when threads intersect
	array 0 - 5
	map thread id to array index
	every sec, clear map but keep colors as pref if thread checks in, if not pref is cleared

stack planes - size number of instances
	override ctor / deconstructor and add counters
	for now put number inside box
	need to research iso view mapping, wpf display
	if ctor/finalize not found, create it
	
use gdi painting without paint event	like wells


wpf
	test cubing tree map, and coloring, default height
	get movement controls working
    block everything, height by instance count
    only hit funcs is very useful to cut down on drawing
    
    wsad/mouselook fly through, click highlights selected
