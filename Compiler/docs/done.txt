show real-time calls between nodes on init graph
instantiation graph
	when new object is created, created an edge from creating class to new class

ellipse text in treemap
get text to show up next to nodes more often
fixed text not showing up on call graph

min height for boxes
outside view in opengl
back button goes back
click reset hit, dont clear nodes being held in

costa rica
----

application as function tree map

highlight hit functions

show path of code between functions

show path as a ranked call graph

extended info with timing information per method

---
put anonymous functions inside function

show instructions added, show data objects tracked

put anon classes in functions

post process class ctor/cctor/anonymous method renaming

rudamentry instance tracking

---

show sequence in time call tree is traversed
	option to align nodes in rank columns by time last called
		nodes called last at bottom, 'coldest' functions at top
	should be able to look at call graph and determine the sequence of events that happened when a call went through
	dont make it time based, but sequence based
	when a function called, just increase its sequence #
	order the ranks by sequence #
	do 2 passes, first pass collect sequences of all nodes
		use to determine the y coord for all nodes
	next pass actually set the y to (height / y) * (step size * function pos)

class view
	see call/graph tree as just class nodes talking
	double click on class node to zoom in and see inner-methdods as a call graph
	the first and last rank are for nodes calling in/out (the same node could be in the 1st and last rank)

---

instances bottom panel tabC:\Main\git\XRay\Library\TimingForm.cs
	option to show just methods and/or fields
	mouse over field should get value for first 10 instances
		useful when you see something talking to a field and you want to see what its set to

	when instance init'd
	this pointer passed to xray
	instance logged af active with 'this' pointer weakly bound
	option in xray to just show active instances
	instance details dialog
		tree/grid, object members on y, instance values along x, max 100, let user page prev/next

	list old to new
	instance object records # of objects created, # destroyed, # alive right now

	flash the class green when constructed, red when destroyed

	could be debugger like with a bottom panel

click node should highlight connected nodes/edges force labels ON

---

recalc values every second if view is in calls/function timing

option to show dependencies direct/all

class dependency graph
	works with structs?

	test - load 2 compilcated modules (ilspy) and verify dependencies all go 1 direction

	use to refactor de-ops into core/ui/sim components
	easier to see dependencies and reactor the easy stuff piece wise
	click on class should show exactly what member variables/parameters/local functions are dependent

	an interactive system would be able to drag drop components between modules as long as there were no internal dependencies
	dependencies between modules should be easy to see/graph as well - subgraphs for each module
		maybe test with dragonly dll hell
