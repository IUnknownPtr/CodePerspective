banshee
	Need to start xray in admin mode
	Need to run nereid in admin mode
	only nereid.exe seems to run, other apps have this problem
		A call to PInvoke function 'XRay.Banshee.Core!Banshee.I18n.Catalog::gettext' has unbalanced the stack. 
		This is likely because the managed PInvoke signature does not match the unmanaged target signature. 
		Check that the calling convention and parameters of the PInvoke signature match the target unmanaged signature.
