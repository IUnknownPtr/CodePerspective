EVERYDAY I SHOULD UNDERSTAND AN XRAYED APP MORE

why isnt main function showing up when resetting hit nodes?
why are some functions the root of a call graph, but not the thread start?

ICSharpCode.ILSpy.CSharpLanguage.DecompileMethod(MethodDefinition method

instances bottom panel tab
	when instance init'd
	this pointer passed to xray
	instance logged af active with 'this' pointer weakly bound
	option in xray to just show active instances
	instance details dialog
		tree/grid, object members on y, instance values along x, max 100, let user page prev/next

	list old to new
	instance object records # of objects created, # destroyed, # alive right now

	flash the class green when constructed, red when destroyed

	could be debugger like with a bottom panel

console bottom panel tab


show sequence in time call tree is traversed
	option to align nodes in rank columns by time last called
		nodes called last at bottom, 'coldest' functions at top
	should be able to look at call graph and determine the sequence of events that happened when a call went through
	dont make it time based, but sequence based
	when a function called, just increase its sequence #
	order the ranks by sequence #
	do 2 passes, first pass collect sequences of all nodes
		use to determine the y coord for all nodes
	next pass actually set the y to (height / y) * (step size * function pos)


rename field with types to anon classes to new name

breadcrumbs showing current zoom level, each level drops down subs

toolbar has show/hide left panel

option to re-organize classes methods 'processClassNames'

keep track anon/external option or just have it able to turn off on client side?

show what the compiler settinsg were of the app when opened with xray

i want to see the value of the variables in realtime
	weak reference map all objects, mapped by type
	click on variable, look at all instances of that object and do toString on values
		possibly reflection of type next, build a psuedo debugger view
		any way to modify the variables during runtime?
		
turn on/off diff tracking types xray side

a left hand panel for turning on/off all options quickly

pan/zoom call graph and tree map with reset view option in menu

could use static int field on classes to track instances, and communication between instances

can hook up to dll without exe?

get code for method

registery to remem last used configuration

spring graph

spring graph with class blogs and functions inside

spring graph 3d

make it look so good people will want to full screen it and use as a screen saver

profile performance

test sample app compiled with mono
	are anonymous functions still re-organized correctly?

need some sort of benchmark to see what xray slowdown is
	maybe use riseop sim mode
	I think it had a second to sim second benchmark..

thread colors
	option to turn on/off
	pick 6 colors, take thread.getHash() % 6 to get index of color
	color nodes/lines between nodes according to hash
	save red for nodes/calls hit by multiple colors

search
	as user types
	sep thread takes latest value in search box
	traverses node tree
		highlights nodes that match
	view mode can be set to only show nodes that match search

website
	email sign-up to get latest news on xray
	paypal to buy xray and have a license generated/sent to you
	forum to discuss

show field grid
	flash red when field set, blue when loaded, purple both
	Mark field as hit when modified
	Easy to see what parts of the app state are being modified
	Would look good on treemap, and also in node graph possibly
	have a tree map panel, below the node graph
		showing a treemap of just fields
		clicking on a field draws lines to functions that modify it

full screen graph in mcforge using all cpu
	are frames being skipped?

zoom in to a class, like a funtion
	and see all calls in/out

double click to zoom / navigate

	right click for extended info


test app has a line in the tree map going to the middle of the class

create call map class to class if class tracking is on
	graph class map
	create node graph inside classes of nodes

use cecil to do assembly modifications
	see if ilspy can be recompiled successfully
	see if can track external mcForge calls
	use recompile to figure out ilspy's de-obfuscate path
	can cecil change a method from private to public?

timing visualization
	break each node into layers
	layer size proportional to amount of time spent on call
	line end points are hooked up to call slice
	use alternating colors for slices cause not enough space for outlines
	pan/zoom becomes more useful when drilling down into calls

class as nodes
	save graph of class to class calls
	class node size by number of active internal items
	save sep node graph for internal class stuff

class instance count tracking

class variables as nodes

get class variable states using reflection (or something)
	can we keep weak references to init'd classes and keep track of how many there are


*** perfect debugging means truely making an application transparent,
  being able to SEE anything out of place instantly




in call graph mode, view external, calls recalc sizes, but does not add other nodes
	if zoom changes should be diff type of redraw?

site written as asp.net dll 
	when the dll is instantiated an xray server is created
	this starts another server that xray remote can be used on
	periodically the remote client sends a compressed bitfield of hit functions
	
most useful
	time vis
	instance tracking
		instance modding

reference tracking
	double click on any node
	in details, get the instance that is getting hit
		double click on instance gets variables
		ability to mod instance details
		ability to call functions on instance directly
			variable builder
	compile everything as public?
	in ctor put weak reference in list
	every class node has a map <hash, weak reference>
		when funcion hit, map checked
		periodically clear references from map
	shade class area purple depending on how many instances exist
	in 3d each reference is a slice
		when slice is hit it lights up
		click on slice and see values of members
		ability to run functions manually
		ability to override function
			stack something else on top of function visually in 3d
		stack slices up to 10, after that, just auto expand on mouse over
	option to show only nodes with active instances

instance tracking
	.ctor calls inst in xlib with class id
		weak ref added to class node

call graph 

	in double pane mode - mouse over a class for instance outlines all NODES in that class blue in the call map

	figure out if enough room next to node for label
		area from middle of node to edges of midpoint between adjacent nodes, and length to next rank - max node's width /2
	view
	   show scope of call graph, really need a splitter or seperate window to show both simultaneously
			mouse overs replicate over both views
	   show options - showing calls from outside of scope- (outside icon)
					  showing calls external to scope - (show external icon)
					  could label as calls to/from xrayed/non xrayed code

	graph spazing when sized by time in func because of slight variations in node size, should stableize somehow

	A -> B, B -> A, temp node should be created so loop can be seen

	real-time mode, (show recently called) build graph based on current active nodes

	left docked view options wouldnt be bad, if tree/call shown simultaneously then splitter there
	right side docked is properties of whats clicked on, each have push pin hiding
	show all calls default in call graph

	reset timing - like reset hit option

	select node - highlight connected edges
	mouse over line - highlight, descriptive tool tip
	
	different entry points should have call lines going form them in diff colors (per graph)
	   so simultaneous actions on graph can be untangled (wells dragging selection box)
	
	def need simultaneous tree view so mouse overs reflect in each
		ideally diff window so simultanous graph types can be opened and worked with simultanously
	
	3d - rotating call graph column
		min points to adjacent ranks
		if points share same coord then space radially
	
stats
	re-calcs/sec,   re-calc time
	re-size/sec,  re-size time
	re-draw/sec, re-draw time
	ability in interface to speedup/slowdown update speed




now2
	try to implement timeInfunc recalc,
		determine if functioncall should use direct links to nodes and not ids
	show new metrics in details, sum children, show object type as column
	light up detail selections
	mouse over give more details in certain view modes

now
	show only nodes that have been recently called in called
	position recently called nodes by way of a descending call tree
		switch to show only hit
		size nodes based on half of available area
		give nodes a charge, lines a spring
		methods in same class attract
		edges have magnetism / spring
		nodes attract/repel baseed on relationship

	details not working when show only hit is on, details of unhit nodes
	real-time search docked on status bar with X to close, like firefox, 
		options to filter or just highlight found nodes
		
	bug - show only hit in test mode
	test - show only hit when zoomed in on unhit

	if calls array near exhausted, make a debug log
		also show number of nodes loaded so i can do mem usage estimates

	thread time graph
		x axis time - moving forward in real time
		y axis each thread
		each function a different color along thread column

	field tracking
	
	layout
		labels
		spring
		3d option for both, xna treemap, xna 3d spring nodes call map

	legend
		colors
		timing - 1000 us in 1 ms / 1000 ms in 1 s / 60 s in 1 m

	details
		blink green outline when navigated
		clicking on call in list, blinks the link
			show under call dots
			
		hook back/forward buttons up to details
		sorting list view
			
		refresh link at bottom
		sum total time of all calls to functions in higher than method details
		timer updating stats
		if same details window already open use that
		tooltips for list headers, say that this, is this, sum is sum of all times in bottom pane
		
	perf menu or dialog
		can show functions with most hits
		functions wiht most time in side
		functions with most time per hit
		reset option to reset timing on a func
		is call rate another metric??
	
	left/right keys - zoom in/out
		
	look at functions with links that are no longer active
		see if function could have returned without triggering an exit
		test a chain of functions a b c d e f, where f throws, and c catches, test that intermediate calls have been cleared

	tool  strip
		clear filtering withen active
		button when errors in the debug log
		item to draw box around smaller or just a group of functions and zoom in only on that
	
	option to not use windows forms, and late bind test with rpc hookups	
	
	override
		allow user to click view MSIL
		user can edit MSIL
		save, compile and activate override
		override needs to be specified as a compile option
		if override, and new code, then run new code, else run original code
		
		can an entire late bound application be written from scratch inside, c#, later compiled without xray bindings, can xray build itself another xray??
		

	hold down tab or a toggle button to show labels in upper right of functions that can fit the label
	
	when going from spring to tree map view, animate rest of map hiding, and called functions remaining, and moving towards gravity

	recompile mscorlib, and put in same dir as software so my internal one is used instead
		test recompiling mscorlib and rest of .net and having it used locally
			see whole app run, debug into windows libs, use ilasm to inspect code
			partner with the red code to get their disassembler
			disassemble their dissassembler to STEAL their disassembler
				reflector has global method - a$PST06000001
			re-compiled reflector failing to launch

	show array/map sizes in debug
		show in debug settings exe was compiled with 
		
	future 
		people write and modify code as the app runs
			able to override funcs and save result
		people can collaborate and write running software in real time
		full introspection and manipulation of all running objects


goal
	if todo items helps me understand app better then its higher on the list
	ill know its ready when i can xray any app and in a few minutes understand how the app works and is structured
	in my brain coding is visual, i make connections between objects, but in practice i dont code with objects, 
		but text and am forced to imagine the visual which blows your mind the larger the program becomes
	then the 3d shit, go gibson
	Test - SwarmNLP (simple), Paint.Net, RiseOp (straight c#), Wells (VB), Storm (many files mixed code), release/debug
		world wind, WPF, mscorlib, reflector
	testing: investigate how color control works in paint.net
	priorities - external, details, spring, 3d
    totally translucent operating system
    get xray working with webstorm / silverlight
    
xray gui
	right click option to show msil for function, or fields of a class, msil could have hyper links to other functions
	mouse over instance count
	   for green nodes (entry points) display the instance count
	current redraw time / fps
	saving current option set to use between runs
		saves current select/ignore settings, user can label as 'transfer graph' etc..
	show notice somewhere on gui if there are entries in the debug log
	how too zoom in on piddly functions?

springs
	only show hit boxes
	free moving, hanging, the repulse each other
	the less related 2 objects are the more repulsive they are
	opens another with boxes connected by strings
	mirrors treemap window, selections, ignores, etc.. the windows are linked
	maybe use a splitter to the user gets 2 concurrent views
	option to spawn more xray windows so differnt classes can be viewed in diff windows, or trees simultaneously

instance tracking
	option in builder that passes 'this' in function call
	xlib stores 'this' in a weak reference map
	user can right click on node and do view instances which allows viewing all the vars of each instance

bugs 
	these files not building - dragonfly.loki, dragonfly.storm.core, DragonFly.Storm.World.Client, DragonFly.Util.Native, DragonFly.Video.MXF
    mscorlib, system.core, reflector
    
build
	options
		track construction, threads
	progress bar of file ops
	ability to pause tracking in interface
	time how long it takes to do redraw, option to draw less frames, option to set fps, which mods frames/timer settings - option in viz
	
release
	need to take out any storm/wells research refs

advanced
	get to work with dlls, users pick entry function, should make asp tracking work
	xray search box, as letters are typed in, matching function name boxes are bolded
	easter egg - extreme zoom in factal hacker code effect
	 
memory tracking
	heap dump tree map ;) can figure out where allocated??
	hash call path to allocated memory
		so we see as a box all strings allocated by a->b->c and its size

function tree map
	how to draw/show anonymous methods
	
	larger xray? these are apps running on your computer as blocks (size by memory, height by cpu) 
		borders are external services - hard drives, network interfaces, sound, display, etc...

sub function tracking
   break every block where there's a branch in msil into it's own node
	  with enter/exit overrides there
   can use normal flow tracking and spring to see how internals of function are operating
	  can't really use names, but can double click code, and the spring org will give a good sense of whats going on
   code coverage stats can be given by tracking hit/unhit blocks
	   shade nodes by percent thats been covered (more red if less covered)
   call lines will come from sub  function of node with-in node
   
3d function tree map
	constant square size, height dependnent on amount of code (cities)
	fly through like hackers
	taller towards middle of box
	load IL and write on the walls of the cube
	black sky
	boxes dark blue semi translucent
	code on walls of box
	code lights up white when function is run
	wsad/mouselook fly through, click highlights selected
	 
	flying white dot cars through program city
	   use 2d xray app to figure out how to generate paths
		  hide everything but methods, and show calls in lanes
			 find shortest path to destination node
  		   start off in direction of node, if hit a wall, chage direction
  		   set height of car based on distance traveling
				 lower = farther, higher = short jumps
     			 color by number of bounaries crossed, class, namespace, 

	 
release 
	open source with donate button
	put donate button in about of app as well,
	link to my page with other projects like rise op, cant hurt


different colors per thread
	each entry instance has an id, could map instance ids to function calls

	6 red orange yellow green blue purple
	black interlace when threads intersect
	array 0 - 5
	map thread id to array index
	every sec, clear map but keep colors as pref if thread checks in, if not pref is cleared

stack planes - size number of instances
	override ctor / deconstructor and add counters
	for now put number inside box
	need to research iso view mapping, wpf display
	if ctor/finalize not found, create it
    
add to xray ability to gen interface from the classes themselves
   work with program directly, manipulate internal variables 
   and inspect those values on the fly
   use try/catch so that iterating exceptions are handled
   or i guess xray would lock object as iterating...

	what better platform for interactive building, debugging, version control and comm
	
release
	when i make a page with all my apps, put link to c0re in about of all apps so can link back

	also good for professors teaching CS
		find schools using C#/VB.Net for the class and ask could it be used as a teaching tool?
		what features would they wany?

	coming into an unfamiliar project and getting a 'sense' of the code quickly
	make a youtube demo video
 
    A useful PRESENTATION tool for engineers to show management how their systems work and inter-operate
		ever want to explain to your manager how the system works easily?
		
		
future
	---X-Ray
	  if xrayed application detects ctrl alt x, current
		app gui is frozen, and xray for app fades over.
	  do for silverlight app as well
		debug interfaces as you build them
		if function doesnt work, fix it in real time
		  so next click doesnt call an exception, but does something.

	  each piece of the app compiles independently
		the code is compiled as the program runs
		  each step fleshing out the program

	GOAL: USE X RAY TO BUILD AN ENTIRE APPLICATION WITHOUT CLOSING 
	IT!!!  Debugging, error checking as new components added. 
	Actual program never closed.
	Taking out one component could cause a whole mesh of components 
	to fail, but never the whole system, always a ROOT component to 
	start from again.  add function, write in C#, compile and 
	attach at runtime inside.  not called directly but wrapped 
	around a component layer that pipes in/out variable 
	input/outputs

	root component is a loop always starting to try starting the 
	first attached components.

	the root component never stops.

	interactive application can be built and never closed. a 
	webserver or 'free' project where people can build components 
	and attach.  links between components could even be over the 
	network.

	might already exist 'in functional' programming. but this is 
	higher level.  the nucleus is procedural.  while the program 
	build on procedural parts is acts functional.
	-----


	xray dll mode starts a mini http server embedded in dll
	   serves div pages colered as blocks
	   use javascript to click blocks zoom

	  each dll has an embedded web server that when activated shows
		whats going on in system

	  if running as http then can go into xray mode at will, release with
		xray inside and debug on demand, use a browser on any machine to
		debug your app. go to the xray port
		every second each http listening xray object pings the main port
		   takes it if available, serves as a directory for other xray
		   apps


	>-------
	IF ALL APPS/DLLS xrayed on system, can view 'insides' of any running process at any time. 

	 when not viewed - full speed, when viewed - html page updtating - 

	http://127.0.0.1:34234:XRay/c/program files/myapp.dll

	entry function checks if xray server up, if not inits it, if entry function already has a 
	version then create a new one
	xray server can be queried for all active running xray instances on the system

	xray instances themselves can be check by xraying xray monitor exe file. then starting up 
	xray server to monitor itself. real test of xray is can it monitor itself

	xray your system dlls and always know what applications are doing

	could run task manager where window is giant tree map of all processes running on the 
	system - everything able to be zoomed in on. complete knowledge of the running system - 
	'seeing' the code. app can see itself run

	XRAY - can IL code be shown for functions, recompiled and injected into the app
	can XRay build a set of dynamic functions that call each other at any time a function can 
	be removed, improved, but the app itself is never turned off
	<---------
