sort thread list by active first or have a submenu for inactive

details ui
	instance
		click on field blink it
		double click on field, pan over to it
		back/forward button, pan to node
	method profile
		click on method, blink it and call line
		double click method pan to it
	click name title in details, select/pan to that node and bring it into zoom if not
	field profile
		show methods that call to/from field

static analyis
	map out method field dependencies and calls for 
	zoom in on a class like the ViewModel class
		see if it's easy to spot where class can be diveded
	if class contains independent graphs, suggest to user that class can be reduced
	graph nodes that fill most available sapce - compact draw mode - on by default for layer graph
	draw code in node when zoomed close enough
	show outside/zoom out in layer graph
	can work on speeding up/debugging graphing with static analysis

layer graph
	**outside zoom/not xrayed view
	figure out top bottom of graph and give next graph more room
	min horizontal distance

	re-run xray on vsVim and see if it's a lot more understandable with the each component in a graph

	don't draw node if smaller than point
		use same draw code as tree map?
    no matter what the size
		set call point to center of parent node if too small to draw
	have a 2 pix area inside node when drawing, if not engouh room then don't draw

graph optimizations
	pan/zoom shouldnt have to call resize
	apply pan/zoom in renderer can be option that opengl views turn off to do pan/zoom as transformation
	currently pan/zoom runs many resize cylcles, after change should take no resize cycles

	background and outline colors saved in vbo
	draw overlays dynamically inbetween - overlays blended
	destroy color not showing for test app in openGL modes

	maybe make another column if not enough room in rank

linked source on screen
	precalculate size of c# code word wrapped with 80 char max
	when user is zoomed in enough to display the width, display it
		mouse wheel over code scrolls it
	have call link originate directly from hyper text function
	when person clicks on function link, app 'flys' over to that function, zoom out/zoom in, like google earth
	at end - user should see class graph, zoom into method graph, zoom into code, click on code links and zoom to connected functions
	field text light up with set/get performed
	give an occurance ID for functions, so can match up exactly which call from method was used

real source editing
	given a directory of source files
	match source functions with methods
	example, xray xlibrary, open in analyze and match with source files
	if field/method dependencies graphed then there is a graph to start from
	allow user to drag nodes in rank and pin node positions in each rank static

explore apps
	**why xtestapp code not being generated for linked dll
	turn on exception catching for code generation
	do another asp test
	upgrade ilspy/cecil

fps view
	improve lighting world and on user
	profile rendering THEN find savings
	flag to redraw nodes / call lines
	keep vertex color array seperate and mod/load that per run
	port advanced drawing to 2d opengl
	port advanced drawing to gdi+
	support for only redrawing threadline on change
	mouse look button?
	call lines as 5 line arc though the sky
	write code on walls - texture sides of blocks with C#, MSIL, Timing, and Instance info
	size fields by instance count
	vector font?
	
color profile 
	obsidian colors - code/console view too
	change at run time
	load from file
	serialize to xml
	jurassic park lulz - green horizon - draw back wall iso view?

class graph
    **double click method node, go into method graph mode and just show that
	**see if class graph can be derived from functions on draw, and we can remove class tracking from xlibrary
	**call lines going backwards, not looking too good in gl
	double click zoomed in class node, show method graph, save view mode in history

treemap view
	Put sub-classses inside parent classes so functions/methods are adacent?

threadline
	shade bg of alternate threads
	add last run time to mouse over in threadline
	if fields selected in thread line
		show fields as row at bottom, at mid-point between accessing threads

method/field dependency graph 
	built on re-compile like class dependency graph

xlibrary
	**fix dupe nodes getting created for templated classes - Dictionary<>, etc..
	move covered nodes into view model so different UIs dont share the same covered node set

about tab 
	put about panel in builder and viewer	
	github address, swax homepage, donate/biitcoin account
	thanks - opentk, quickfont, cecil, icsharp, stackoverflow

Thread filter
	Different colors for call lines when viewing multiple threads
	Option to 'intersect' on thread filter menu, just show nodes with threads in common

builder
	 build stats - time, dat size
	 post-build command line to xray a build in debug mode so dev at any time can start introspex monitor
	 show what the compiler settinsg were of the app when opened with xray
	 rename field with types to anon classes to new name
	 ability in interface to speedup/slowdown update speed

scanner panel
	option to recompile and remove signing
	maybe need to create unique dat file name if multiple will be in the same directory
	!!combined viewer!! - can load in multiple dats into same work space and shows updates accordingly
	combined stack? if multiple dlls xrayed independently, could they detect they're in the same process and share the stack tracker?
	install windows 8 VM and test scanning entire system
		!!save snapshot before doing scan/replae

code paths as a tree
	clickin on node in tree shows subset
	tree shows last run
	there is 'something' here, there a 'code paths' that get run periodically
		how can i define and show these paths, catagorize by time freq?

unit-tests built in
	ability to run funtions manually
	can visually see real code block run and affected code blocks

incorporate sound somehow?

error handling
	try to handle paint.net crashing with xray
	maybe first pass source show's MSIL

apps
	facebook - no longer working - mixed mode assembly error
	deOps - problem expanding dictionaries keyvalue elements in some classes
	openTK - gives an assembly reference not found on compile
	github - not working
	test app - 'trystuff' in test app not decompiling, unresolved ref
	xlibrary - method dependency graph to see if ViewModel can be refactored
	paint.net photshop.dll recompile/view not working..
	vsvim - works but rediculously complicated, i think if apps are built with xray from the start they'd look better, idk

instance view
	click title in instance view - focus on node in under current root, if zoomed into far, zoom out, or make outside visible
	show fields in instance view even if no instances created
	clicking on field should highlight in instance grid and vice versa
	ivcryptostream not showing anything still
	hyperlink in instance view to check out base types, etc..
	search on instance page
	ability to modify values
	ability to prevent deleting of references by 'locking' on refresh, keeping list of instances not weak refs
	button to show next/prev page of instances?
	detect cyclic references in instance browser

search box
	show count next to search box for found #, clicking on # filters display to those nodes
	state graph + function graph ( show inter-state calls, and calls between states ) = total program understanding
	search also highlights code/instances

profile
	blink green outline when navigated
	clicking on call in list, blinks the link
		show under call dots

console tab
   run funtions on existing instances manually
   change field values

help tab
	scrolls down
	legend
		show current colors
		let user set diff colors, load/save configs
		standard, matrix
		call graph - red calls/dependent on, blue - converse

look at functions with links that are no longer active
	see if function could have returned without triggering an exit
	test a chain of functions a b c d e f, where f throws, and c catches, test that intermediate calls have been cleared


-------------------------------------------- ADVANCED --------------------------------------------

self compiling
	put xCompiler in xLib dll
	copy exe/dlls on compile and save markers where source can be read from them
	while xraying dll, show source code directly ripped from source exe/dll
	allow user to modify source
	re-compile exe/dlls
	re-xray compiled exe/dlls
	re-start xray'd exe

override
	user can edit MSIL
	save, compile and activate override
	override needs to be specified as a compile option
	if override, and new code, then run new code, else run original code
	msil could have hyper links to other functions
		
	can an entire late bound application be written from scratch inside, c#, 
	later compiled without xray bindings, can xray build itself another xray??
	
recompile mscorlib, and put in same dir as software so my internal one is used instead
	test recompiling mscorlib and rest of .net and having it used locally

future 
	people write and modify code as the app runs
		able to override funcs and save result
	people can collaborate and write running software in real time
	full introspection and manipulation of all running objects

memory tracking - heap dump tree map 

tracking file system, network access from graph?

sub function tracking
   break every block where there's a branch in msil into it's own node
	  with enter/exit overrides there
   can use normal flow tracking and spring to see how internals of function are operating
	  can't really use names, but can double click code, and the spring org will give a good sense of whats going on
   code coverage stats can be given by tracking hit/unhit blocks
	   shade nodes by percent thats been covered (more red if less covered)
   call lines will come from sub  function of node with-in node
   
future editor
	click on blocks, edit code
	f5 launches app and everything starts lighting up
	the end of multiple files for projects
		everything is in one file, accessible by a logical tree
		can find classes/vars quickly by typing the name like itunes
	integrate with visual studio for real editing, post build step to use xray

remote monitoring dll plugins to webserver
	xray dll mode starts a mini http server embedded in dll
	   serves div pages colered as blocks
	   use javascript to click blocks zoom

	  each dll has an embedded web server that when activated shows
		whats going on in system

	  if running as http then can go into xray mode at will, release with
		xray inside and debug on demand, use a browser on any machine to
		debug your app. go to the xray port
		every second each http listening xray object pings the main port
		   takes it if available, serves as a directory for other xray
		   apps

	when the dll is instantiated an xray server is created
	this starts another server that xray remote can be used on
	periodically the remote client sends a compressed bitfield of hit functions

	
system xray converter
	scan system for .net exe's and dlls
	recompile all with xray
	when anything starts up it finds the running xray process and gives it a handle to be hooked into whenever

future
	---X-Ray
	  if xrayed application detects ctrl alt x, current
		app gui is frozen, and xray for app fades over.
	  do for silverlight app as well
		debug interfaces as you build them
		if function doesnt work, fix it in real time
		  so next click doesnt call an exception, but does something.

	  each piece of the app compiles independently
		the code is compiled as the program runs
		  each step fleshing out the program

	GOAL: USE X RAY TO BUILD AN ENTIRE APPLICATION WITHOUT CLOSING 
	IT!!!  Debugging, error checking as new components added. 
	Actual program never closed.
	Taking out one component could cause a whole mesh of components 
	to fail, but never the whole system, always a ROOT component to 
	start from again.  add function, write in C#, compile and 
	attach at runtime inside.  not called directly but wrapped 
	around a component layer that pipes in/out variable 
	input/outputs

	root component is a loop always starting to try starting the 
	first attached components.

	the root component never stops.

	interactive application can be built and never closed. a 
	webserver or 'free' project where people can build components 
	and attach.  links between components could even be over the 
	network.

	might already exist 'in functional' programming. but this is 
	higher level.  the nucleus is procedural.  while the program 
	build on procedural parts is acts functional.
	-----


	>-------
	IF ALL APPS/DLLS xrayed on system, can view 'insides' of any running process at any time. 

	 when not viewed - full speed, when viewed - html page updtating - 

	http://127.0.0.1:34234:XRay/c/program files/myapp.dll

	entry function checks if xray server up, if not inits it, if entry function already has a 
	version then create a new one
	xray server can be queried for all active running xray instances on the system

	xray instances themselves can be check by xraying xray monitor exe file. then starting up 
	xray server to monitor itself. real test of xray is can it monitor itself

	xray your system dlls and always know what applications are doing

	could run task manager where window is giant tree map of all processes running on the 
	system - everything able to be zoomed in on. complete knowledge of the running system - 
	'seeing' the code. app can see itself run

	XRAY - can IL code be shown for functions, recompiled and injected into the app
	can XRay build a set of dynamic functions that call each other at any time a function can 
	be removed, improved, but the app itself is never turned off
	<---------
